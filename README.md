# Gradient Lexicase Selection for NCA on ARC-AGI

This repo is the home of my in progress code for my senior computer science thesis at Amherst College. I am exploring how evolving neural cellular automata with a specific technique 
called gradient lexicase selection affects their performance on the ARC-AGI benchmark.
